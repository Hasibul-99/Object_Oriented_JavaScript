# Object Oriented JavaScript

<h2>Constructors </h2>

<p>There can be only one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. Having more than one occurrence of a constructor method in a class will throw a SyntaxError error.</p>

<p>A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.</p>

<p>If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class.</p>

<p>Inheritance in most class-based object-oriented languages is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of another object. JavaScript is not a class-based language although class keyword is introduced in ES2015, it is just syntactical layer. JavaScript still works on prototype chain.</p>

<p>Child class can't use constructor</p>
